title: A Tale of Two Cities
---

I had an unenviable chore day on the Sixth of August. Among other things, I had to go to the Regional Transport Office (RTO), Koramangala and the Citibank branch down at MG Road. There was a huge difference in the quality of services rendered, the way I was handled and how I felt after my chore was done.

The first thing that catches your nose is the smell of urine as you walk past the toilet on your way to the RTO office on the second floor. As you climb up the musty stairwell, you can see the distemper chipping off in places and feel the dampness in the air. I arrive at the second floor. There is a broad table optimistically branded 'Reception'. I enquire. The disinterested gentleman on the other side of the table gestures generally towards a room.

I step in. There is a wide counter. About eight employees sit on the other side. I ask about my chore. They call a guy. He walks over to a part of the counter that is somewhat split from the rest. There lies a computer. The screen blinking to life the first time today. He asks me to wait as he does not know the password to an application. I wait. About an hour. I start to get impatient and begin asking others nearby. Everybody keeps saying they don't know the password. I'm told to go to another room where I'll find another guy who knows the password and he should come in and enter it.

It takes me about ten minutes to find that guy's seat. The other room is far more crowded. Lines snake through the hallway and are spilling out onto the corridor. Everyone is there to have their photographs taken. Anyway, the guy is not at his seat. I begin asking around. No one is willing to place a phone call. I ask for the password, people act like they don't know what I'm talking about. After about ten more minutes, that guy comes in. He senses I'm looking for someone and asks. I tell him about the password problem. He barks a few statements and another guy (who had been there the whole time) stands up and starts brisk walking to the first room I went into. There, he swiftly enters the password and wraps up my chore in a record four seconds. Four seconds! I spent an hour and a half waiting for someone to enter a password. Had that computer been logged in-to as part of the daily setup, I would have been done in seconds.

Phew! But that was only half the day, wasn't it?

Next up, Citibank, MG Road. Banks are slow, unresponsive, right? Well, no. I walked in. A security guard politely asked me what I needed. I tried my best to explain. He said I was in the wrong hall and I should go into the adjacent hall. So I did. Now, this hall meant business.

It was as large as the RTO office, but it was inviting. There were welcoming chairs and pouffes at the center of the hall. There were five small open cabins with customers discussing their cases with Citi representatives. There were some numbered teller counters. There was a water dispenser should you need it. But most importantly, there was a reception as soon as you entered. This reception did not need quotes. The gentleman on the other side asked my case, figured out the kind of service I required and gave me a token. He asked me to await my turn. I waited, for about 20 minutes. Sitting on one of those rather comfortable pouffes. I was finally called into one of the cubes. My matter sorted in another 20 minutes and I was out the door.

There were some other issues. I had to go to the teller's counter, put in a form that I was helped out with and wait for an approval. But all in all, I was surprised with the comfort with which the folks at citi sorted my issue out.

Now, I don't think this is an incurable situation. What we should expect our government's institutions is closer to the Citibank system. Atleast the frontends. The ones which directly engage with citizens. I have seen systems similar to the citibank one in governments. It is in Visa application centres. [VFS Global][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VFS_Global] partners with governments and handles the administrative and non-discretionary parts of visa applications for millions of citizens through out the world.

If we look closely, government institutions are bureaucratic, ineffective because they have been setup that way. Not because that's how it must be. We can make things better by aligning incentives with citizen outcomes.

Maybe to start with, we could create a separate entity that delivers frontend services to citizens. One that is charged with figuring out the best possible ways to manage the operations in a high volume environment. Bangalore did try one out in the form of [BangaloreOne][http://www.bangaloreone.gov.in/]. I have no idea how it worked out for the citizens, but there is definitely scope for betterment.
