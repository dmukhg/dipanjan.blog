title: When great intentions have bad outcomes
---
I'm going to say it. Often, I will see bad outcomes and immmediately think that bad intentions led to this. 

This is wrong.

Great intentions, do not necessarily lead to great outcomes. The next time you find yourself questioning somebody's motives when things turn bad, take a step back. Figure out how you can train, assist or persuade them to realise great outcomes as well.

Persusasion may be necessary. The Sanskrit word (विवेक/Vivek: _n_, wisdom, ability to differentiate good from bad) comes to mind. When things are not what you expect, unless you are super-calm, you will lose the ability to analyse and strategise objectively. You will try to externalise the blame. In such times, some one you can trust would need to calm you down and show you a path.

Be the one who others trust. Be the one who can persuade. Be the one who can be asked to help out in times like these. Be kind, be honest and be generous with your advice.

That's how you build resilient networks.
