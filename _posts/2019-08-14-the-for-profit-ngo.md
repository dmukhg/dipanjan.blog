Is it possible for NGOs to be, and to remain, For-Profit?

NGOs are free of government bureaucracy and are able to setup their own processess and structures to deliver services. They can be agents of change and of innovation. But can they be for-profit? And if so, can they remain true to their mission?

Being for-profit allows hiring experts and generally smart people full-time. Assuming the output of such people working in tandem is beyond the cost, how can we ensure that the mission does not change to wholly-profit-focussed or even exploitative.

As a thought experiment, imagine you are the morally upright, devoted CEO of an NGO that builds out sanitation and sewage systems for the under-privileged rural villages. You have been doing so for years now and have seen some profit. Profit that you have spread across your employees. You have hired better support staff, leased out a new office and provided health-care for your contractors.

Now, the time is ripe for you to move on to another venture. You must select a new CEO. How do you go about ensuring that they do not stop doing the good work that you started?

What, short of a personal moral compass, can be used to nudge folks into an NGO's goals?
