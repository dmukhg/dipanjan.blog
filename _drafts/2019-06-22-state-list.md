title: Why the State List in the Constitution gives me hope.
---

The Constitution of India provides for a balanced devolution of power to states. India has a Federal Structure. This means it has states and the states have their own elections and are empowered to make decisions locally.

That said, India is not _fully_ Federal in nature. That would have meant that states would have significant governance and revenue power. As we shall shortly see, this is not the case.

This was a conscious call taken by the Constituent Assembly. If we had a fully Federal system with near-complete devolution of power to the states, things might not have turned out well. Some states had joined the Union of India [grudgingly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vallabhbhai_Patel#Integration_after_Independence_and_role_of_Gandhi). To the north, the Partition meant a precedent for those seeking to secede from the Union. Unbridled devloution of power, in this environment, would have reduced the dependency of the states on the Union and threatened its unity.

The [Seventh Schedule of the Constitution](https://www.india.gov.in/sites/upload_files/npi/files/coi-eng-schedules_1-12.pdf) provides for division of powers. It is a set of guidelines on which power is devolved to the state.

I believe that a Federal structure allows for competition between the states that are a part of the Federation. Competition between states, much like free markets, should be able to identify policies and processes that allow for greatest strides in development.

This natural competition, however, is constrained in India. I believe that is because of two reasons:
1. Lack of objective measures of progress and indicators of growth
2. The Union's dominating control on the purse

The NITI Aayog has recently tried to remedy [1] by [ranking states](http://social.niti.gov.in/) on social sector outcomes like public health, water security and education.

Coming back to the Seventh Schedule. In this post, we will look at the various aspects of the State List and see the nature of the power that resides with the states. After that, we will cover some policy suggestions that could grant the state more control over local development within the rights provided to it by the Constitution.

First, lets look at some of the subjects that the states have jurisdiction on. The categorisation is my own ðŸ˜…. The Constitution does not classify the subjects.
